# hello-world
My first repository, created follwing the "Hello World" Github guide.

This guide asked me to write a little bit about me in the readme file. I am learning github to see if
it is the tool I need to solve my coding issues both with application creation and with economic
research. Additionally, I want to learn git and github so that I can interact with research projects
and code repositories created by others.
